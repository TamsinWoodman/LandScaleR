\usage{
calculateKernelDensities(
  ref_map_cells_df,
  ref_map_df,
  LC_class,
  ref_map_cell_resolution,
  kernel_radius = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref_map_cells_df}{Subset of rows from the `ref_map_df` data frame
that contains the grid cells for which you want to calculate kernel
densities.}

\item{ref_map_df}{Data frame of the reference map for the current timestep.}

\item{LC_class}{Single land cover class for which to calculate kernel
densities. Must be a column name in `ref_map_cells_df` and
`ref_map`.}

\item{ref_map_cell_resolution}{Resolution of one cell in the reference map,
in the form `c(x, y)`.}

\item{kernel_radius}{Radius of cells to include in the kernel density
calculation. A value of 1 means that the neighbour cells used to calculate
kernel density will be 1 cell in every direction around the focal cell.
Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
Data frame with the kernel density value for the given land cover
  class in each cell.
}
\description{
Calculates kernel densities for one land cover class for a subset of
  reference map cells.
