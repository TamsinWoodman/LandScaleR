	abstract = {The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) is a global integrated assessment model used to project future societal and environmental scenarios, based on economic modeling and on a detailed representation of food and energy production systems. The terrestrial module in GCAM represents agricultural activities and ecosystems dynamics at the subregional scale, and must be downscaled to be used for impact assessments in gridded models (e.g., climate models). In this study, we present the downscaling algorithm of the GCAM model, which generates gridded time series of global land use and land cover (LULC) from any GCAM scenario. The downscaling is based on a number of user-defined rules and drivers, including transition priorities (e.g., crop expansion preferentially into grasslands rather than forests) and spatial constraints (e.g., nutrient availability). The default parameterization is evaluated using historical LULC change data, and a sensitivity experiment provides insights on the most critical parameters and how their influence changes regionally and in time. Finally, a reference scenario and a climate mitigation scenario are downscaled to illustrate the gridded land use outcomes of different policies on agricultural expansion and forest management. Several features of the downscaling can be modified by providing new input data or changing the parameterization, without any edits to the code. Those features include spatial resolution as well as the number and type of land classes being downscaled, thereby providing flexibility to adapt GCAM LULC scenarios to the requirements of a wide range of models and applications. The downscaling system is version controlled and freely available.},

	abstract = {HILDA+ (HIstoric Land Dynamics Assessment+) is a global dataset on annual land use/cover change between 1960-2019 at 1 km spatial resolution. It is based on a data-driven reconstruction approach and integrates multiple open data streams (from high-resolution remote sensing, long-term land use reconstructions and statistics). It covers six generic land use/cover categories: 1: Urban areas, 2: Cropland, 3: Pasture/rangeland, 4: Forest, 5: Unmanaged grass/shrubland, 6: Sparse/no vegetation.{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}
HILDA+ contains annual land use/cover states and transitions, which we provide in different versions/ZIP folders:{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}
1) vGLOB-1.0\${\textbackslash}\_\$geotiff: land use/cover states and transition layers as single geotiffs from 1960 to 2019. {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}
2) vGLOB-1.0-f\${\textbackslash}\_\$netcdf: land use/cover states and transition layers as two large netCDF files with extened time span from 1899 to 2019 (including forest class sub-division and dynamics). {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}
3) hildap\${\textbackslash}\_\$vGLOB-1.0\${\textbackslash}\_\$change-layers: Additionally, HILDA+ change layers (change frequency; forest, cropland and pasture/rangeland change 1960-2019) are provided as geotiffs. {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}
4) hildap\${\textbackslash}\_\$vGLOB-1.0\${\textbackslash}\_\$uncertainty: Uncertainty layers are provided as geotiffs in 3 ZIP folders (part1-3), containing annual datasets of uncertainty information: number of input datasets, deviation and average area fraction per land use/cover category.{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}
