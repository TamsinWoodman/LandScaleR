#' S4 class to hold a land cover map with associated properties
#'
#' @slot LC_map Data frame containing a land cover map. First two columns must
#'   contain x- and y-coordinates for the map. Each subsequent column contains
#'   the area of a given land cover class per cell.
#' @slot agg_LC_map For fine-scale maps only, contains a copy of `LC_map` that
#'   has been aggregated into coarse-scale grid cells.
#' @slot LC_classes Vector of land cover classes in the `LC_map` slot. Must be
#'   the same as land cover class column names in the `LC_map` data frame.
#' @slot grid_cell_area Gives the area of each grid cell in the `LC_map` data
#'   frame where an equal-area projection is used.
#' @slot resolution Vector with the x- and y-dimensions of each grid cell where
#'   all grid cells have the same resolution. Should be provided in the format
#'   `c(x, y)`.

#' @slot kernel_radius Value for radius of cells used to calculate kernel
