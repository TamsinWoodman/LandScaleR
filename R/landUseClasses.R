#' S4 class to hold processed land cover deltas
#'
#' An S4 class with slots for the reference map and processed land cover delta
#'   values.
#'
#' @slot ref_map_df Data frame of the reference map, where each row is one
#'   raster cell.
#' @slot LC_deltas Data frame of land cover changes between two coarse-scale
#'   timesteps. Must be the same projection as the `ref_map_df`
#' @slot LC_types Character vector with the land-use types. The land-use
#'   types should be the same in each data frame.
