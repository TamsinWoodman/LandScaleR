#' Downscale land cover data
#'
#' Downscales land cover by applying land cover change from coarse-scale input
#'   maps to a fine-scale reference map. The method used for downscaling land
#'   cover is based on that in West et al. (2014) and Le Page et al. (2016).
#'   Briefly, all fine-scale reference map cells are assigned to a single
#'   coarse-scale cell using a nearest neighbour approach. Kernel density values
#'   are calculated for each fine-scale cell and land cover type based on the
#'   amount of each land cover type in neighbouring cells. The kernel density
#'   values are used during the land cover allocation process to determine how
#'   much of a land cover type should be allocated to each grid cell; cells with
#'   higher kernel density values will be allocated more land cover. Land cover
#'   change is allocated in three steps: intensification, expansion, followed by
#'   a second round of intensification.
#'
#'   Land cover allocation is performed in three steps: a first round of
#'   intensification, where land cover is allocated to cells where it already
#'   occurs; a round of expansion, where land cover is allocated to cells where
#'   it does not exist; and a final round of intensification to ensure that all
#'   land cover change has been allocated. The `intensification_ratio` parameter
#'   specifies how much land cover the algorithm should attempt to allocate via
#'   intensification versus expansion. An intensification ratio of 0.8 gives a
#'   target of 80\% of land cover to be allocated via intensification and 20\%
#'   by expansion.
#'
#' @param ref_map_file_name Path of file name for the reference map for
#'   downscaling. The reference map file should be in tab-separated format with
#'   the extension `.txt`. The resolution of the reference map will determine
#'   the resolution of the output downscaled land cover maps.
#' @param LC_deltas_file_list List of file names for land cover change (delta).
#'   The algorithm expects one land cover change file per time step. All land
#'   cover change files must be in tab-separated format with the `.txt` file
#'   extension. The list must be ordered by time, with the first time step being
#'   the first file in the list, the second time step the second file, and so
#'   on. Land cover change files can be generated using the `calculateLCDeltas`
#'   function from this package.
#' @inheritParams processLCDeltas
#' @inheritParams calculateKernelDensities
#' @inheritParams runLCAllocation
#' @param output_file_prefix Prefix for output downscaled land cover map files.
#' @param output_dir_path Path to directory in which to saved the downscaled
#'   land cover map files.
#'
#' @return Tab-separated text files containing downscaled land cover maps, with
#'   one file per input land cover change file. In each output file, the first
#'   two columns are x and y coordinates for the map. Subsequent columns contain
#'   land cover for each cell. The 'ref_ID' column gives an identification
#'   number for each grid cell, and the 'coarse_ID' column specifies the
#'   coarse-scale cell to which each fine-scale cell was assigned to during
#'   downscaling.
