## Introduction to LandScaleR

Land use and land cover (LULC) projections are required for a wide range of 
models that predict the effect of land use on environmental variables, such as
biodiversity and hydrology. However, land use models do not always generate 
projections at adequate resolution for use in other models. The **LandScaleR** 
R package implements an algorithm for spatial downscaling of LULC projections to
fine resolutions that are suitable for environmental modelling.

The **LandScaleR** algorithm takes coarse resolution maps of LULC change and
allocates the change to a fine resolution reference map. Minimal input data is 
required as new areas of LULC are allocated to grid cells in the reference map 
based on kernel densities, which quantify the density of each LULC class in the 
neighbourhood of a focal cell [@LePage2016]. Three methods of LULC allocation 
are provided in **LandScaleR**:

* **Quasi-deterministic** (`"deterministic"`): new LULC areas are allocated to
reference map grid cells in order from highest to lowest kernel density. Cells 
with a kernel density equal to zero are randomly ordered, hence the "quasi" part
of the method name.
* **Fuzzy** (`"fuzzy"`): new LULC areas are allocated to reference map grid 
cells in order from highest to lowest kernel density, but each kernel density is 
adjusted before the cells are ordered. To adjust kernel densities, each one is 
summed with an adjustment drawn from a Normal distribution $N(0, f \sigma)$, 
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the kernel densities and $f$ is 
specified by the user. Increasing $f$ leads to less aggregated patterns of LULC 
in the downscaled maps.
* **Random** (`"null_model"`): new LULC areas are added to the reference map at
random.

**LandScaleR** is capable of downscaling multiple timesteps of LULC change 
because each downscaled map becomes the reference map for downscaling the 
subsequent timestep of LULC change. The radius of cells used to calculate kernel
densities and the $f$ parameter can both be altered to generate downscaled maps
with different LULC patterns. Given the minimal use of covariate data in 
**LandScaleR** it is not intended to generate highly accurate LULC maps, but
instead to produce theoretical future landscapes that can be used to represent 
fine resolution LULC in environmental models.

## Using LandScaleR: downscaling LULC change in the UK

Here, we demonstrate how to use the **LandScaleR** R package to downscale LULC 
change in the UK from 2009 to 2012.

### Input maps

Downscaling requires two sets of input maps: a time series of LULC change maps, 
and a reference map at the resolution to which you want to downscale the LULC 
change maps. The LULC change maps used in this example are at 0.5^o^ resolution 
and were generated from the HILDA+ dataset [@winkler2020hglu] by summing the 
area of each LULC class within the 0.5^o^ grid cells. The LULC change maps cover
the time period from 2009 to 2012, with three files each containing one year of 
LULC change. Each LULC change file in this example contains ten layers, and 
every layer name is "LC" appended with a numeric code that refers to one LULC 
class: 

| Code | LULC class |
| --- | --- |
| 11 | Urban |
| 22 | Cropland |
| 33 | Pasture |
| 40 | Unknown/other forest |
| 41 | Evergreen, needle leaf forest |
| 44 | Deciduous, broad leaf forest |
| 45 | Mixed forest |
| 55 | Grass/shrubland |
| 66 | Other land |
| 77 | Water |

The 'terra' package is used here to load and view the LULC change map for 2009 
to 2010.

```{r Load LULC change 2009-2010}
library("terra")

LULC_change_2009_2010_file <- system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LUC_2009_2010.tif",
                                          package = "LandScaleR")
LULC_change_2009_2010 <- rast(LULC_change_2009_2010_file)
LULC_change_2009_2010
```

Change in LULC can be plotted to assess how much LULC change is going to be 
downscaled each year; here, we plot the change in cropland and pasture in the UK 
between 2009 and 2010.

```{r Plot LULC change 2009 2010,echo=FALSE,fig.height=4,fig.width=7,fig.cap="Change in area (km^2^) of cropland and pasture in the UK at 0.5^o^ spatial resolution from 2009 to 2010."}
layout(matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2), 
       nrow = 1, 
       ncol = 5,
       byrow = TRUE))
plot(LULC_change_2009_2010[[c("LC22")]],
     col = continuous_LUC_palette,
     mar = c(1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1),
     legend = FALSE,
     main = c(LC_classes_display[2]),
     axes = FALSE,
     range = c(-175, 175))
plot(LULC_change_2009_2010[[c("LC33")]],
     col = continuous_LUC_palette,
     mar = c(1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 9.1),
     main = c(LC_classes_display[3]),
     axes = FALSE,
     range = c(-175, 175))
```

The reference map must give LULC at the start of the time series of LULC change 
maps, so here we use LULC in the UK in 2009 as the reference map to downscale 
LULC change in the UK from 2009 to 2012. The reference map is at approximately
0.01^o^ resolution, contains one LULC class per cell, and was also derived from 
the HILDA+ LULC dataset [@winkler2020hglu]. The reference and LULC change maps
must have the same geographic projection, but they do not need to cover exactly
the same extent. The values in the UK 2009 reference map use the same numeric
code to represent LULC classes as the LULC change maps.

```{r Load LULC in 2009}
reference_2009_file <- system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LULC_2009.tif",
                              package = "LandScaleR")
reference_2009 <- rast(reference_2009_file)
reference_2009
```

```{r Plot LULC in 2009,echo = FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="UK LULC in 2009 at approximately 0.01^o^ resolution from the HILDA+ dataset."}
levels(reference_2009) <- LC_levels
plot(reference_2009,
     col = discrete_LC_palette,
     mar = c(3.1, 3.1, 2.1, 11),
     axes = FALSE)
```

### Run downscaling

The first step to downscale LULC change in the UK is to load the **LandScaleR** 
package.

```{r setup}
library("LandScaleR")
```

Next, set up the `match_LC_classes` matrix which matches the LULC classes in the
LULC change maps to those in the reference map. In this example all maps contain
the same LULC classes, so we set up a matrix which matches each LULC class to
itself. The **LandScaleR** package will prepend each LULC class with "LC" if a 
discrete reference map (one LULC class per cell) with no associated categories 
is provided because numeric LULC classes do not work in the algorithm. 
Therefore, if you are using a discrete reference map with no categories make 
sure to add "LC" to the start of every reference map LULC class name in the 
`match_LC_class` matrix, as shown below.

```{r Create match_LC_classes}
LULC_map_classes <- paste0("LC",
                           c("11", "22", "33", "40", "41", "44", "45", "55", "66", "77"))
ref_map_classes <- paste0("LC",
                           c("11", "22", "33", "40", "41", "44", "45", "55", "66", "77"))

match_LC_classes <- matrix(data = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                                    0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                                    0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                                    0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                                    0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                                    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                                    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
                                    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 
                                    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
                                    0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1),
                           byrow = TRUE,
                           nrow = 10,
                           ncol = 10,
                           dimnames = list(LULC_map_classes,
                                           ref_map_classes))
```

Run the **LandScaleR** algorithm using the `downscaleLC()` function. We use the
`"deterministic"` method of LULC allocation here, which means that grid cells
closest to existing patches of LULC will be the first to receive new LULC areas.
You may want to change the `output_file_prefix` and `output_dir_path` arguments 
to directories on your computer before running the code below.

```{r Run downscaling,eval=FALSE}
downscaleLC(ref_map_file_name = system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LULC_2009.tif",
                                            package = "LandScaleR"),                         # File path of the fine resolution reference map
            LC_deltas_file_list = list(system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LUC_2009_2010.tif",
                                                   package = "LandScaleR"),
                                       system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LUC_2010_2011.tif",

                                                   package = "LandScaleR")),                 # List of file paths to the LULC change maps, in time series order
            ref_map_type = "discrete",                                                           # Whether the reference map contains one LULC class per cell or the area of each LULC class per cell
            cell_size_unit = "km",                                                               # Unit in which LandScaleR should calculate grid cell sizes, here we use km
            match_LC_classes = match_LC_classes,                                                 # Matrix showing how the LULC change map classes are matched to the reference map classes
            kernel_radius = 1,                                                                   # Radius of cells to include in the kernel density calculation
            simulation_type = "deterministic",                                                   # Method of LULC allocation to use in LandScaleR

            discrete_output_map = TRUE,                                                          # Whether to output discrete as well as area-based downscaled maps
            random_seed = 1675,                                                                  # Random seed, so that simulation results can be reproduced
            output_file_prefix = "UK_DS_example",                                                # Prefix for downscaled maps
            output_dir_path = "LandScaleR_example/")                                         # Directory in which to store the output downscaled maps
```

When running the `downscaleLC()` function to downscale the example LULC change 
maps from the UK you might see warning messages such as the one below:

```{r Harmonisation warning,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Harmonisation_warning.png")
```

These warning messages occur when the **LandScaleR** algorithm is unable to 
allocate LULC change from one coarse resolution grid cell to the reference map.
At first, the algorithm attempts to allocate LULC change from one coarse
resolution cell to a set of reference map cells. Every reference map grid cell
is assigned to their nearest coarse resolution cell by **LandScaleR**, so they 
can only receive new LULC from that coarse cell. In some cases **LandScaleR** 
will be unable to allocate LULC change from a coarse resolution cell to its 
assigned reference map cells. For example, let us assume that cropland increases
by 100 km^2^ in a coarse resolution cell in one timestep but the assigned 
reference map cells are already entirely covered by cropland. **LandScaleR** 
will be unable to place more cropland in the reference map cells, so 100 km^2^ 
of cropland will be unallocated. After **LandScaleR** has attempted to allocate 
LULC change from all coarse resolution cells to the reference map it starts a 
process called 'harmonisation', where the algorithm places unallocated LULC 
change in neighbouring coarse resolution cells. The `harmonisation_radius` 
argument can be used to set the number of neighbouring cells that are searched
during the haronisation process. When **LandScaleR** is unable to place all 
unallocated LULC change on the reference map during harmonisation it prints out
a warning such as the one above, showing which coarse resolution cells still 
have unallocated LULC change and how much.

In the example of downscaling LULC change in the UK from 2009 to 2012 the 
warning messages for unallocated LULC are expected to occur for a few cells 
where there is a difference in the total land area in HILDA+ between two years.
For instance, in the example message above there was a 0.64 km^2^ increase in 
pasture area  that was unallocated in grid cell -1.25, 60.25. There was no 
corresponding decrease in another LULC class, meaning that the total area of 
land in HILDA+ must have increased by 0.64 km^2^ in this coarse cell and year,
probably due to a coastal grid cell being added in HILDA+. It is recommended to
check these warning messages carefully as they could be due to mismatches in the
underlying data, or due to differences between LULC change projections and LULC
in the reference map. Note that any unallocated LULC change is also saved as a
table in the file ending 'unallocated_LC.txt' to allow for further investigation
after downscaling.

Another warning message that might appear during downscaling is:

```{r mosaic warning,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Mosaic_warning.png")
```

This warning message is generated because the reference map cells are cropped 
into one `terra::SpatRaster` object per coarse resolution cell during the 
downscaling process, to ensure that LULC change in each coarse cell can be 
allocated independently from other coarse cells. Occasionally there may be cases
where reference map grid cells at the edge of two coarse resolution cells are 
counted in both cells. We believe this results in the warning message saying 
that rasters are not aligned when the individual reference map 
`terra:SpatRaster` objects are merged back together using the `terra::mosaic()` 
function at the end of downscaling one timestep. This warning is likely to 
affect a very small number of reference grid cells and should not lead to any 
missing grid cells as the `terra::mosiac()` documentation states that the values
from the last `terra::SpatRaster` to be merged will be retained in places where 
two `terra::SpatRaster` objects overlap.

## Calibration of LandScaleR

The different methods of LULC allocation (`"deterministic"`, "`fuzzy`" and 
`"null_model"`) provided in **LandScaleR** generate varying patterns of LULC in 
the output downscaled maps. Multiple timesteps of LULC are provided by HILDA+, 
so we can use HILDA+ to test which method of LULC allocation best reproduces 
historic LULC patterns. For example, here we run `downscaleLC()` with the 
`"fuzzy"` method of LULC allocation and $f = 1.5$.

```{r Run downscaling fuzzy 1.5,eval=FALSE}
downscaleLC(ref_map_file_name = system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LULC_2009.tif",
                                            package = "LandScaleR"),
            LC_deltas_file_list = list(system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LUC_2009_2010.tif",
                                                   package = "LandScaleR"),
                                       system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LUC_2010_2011.tif",
                                                   package = "LandScaleR"),
                                       system.file("extdata/20221006_HILDA_UK_LUC_2011_2012.tif",
                                                   package = "LandScaleR")),
            ref_map_type = "discrete",
            cell_size_unit = "km",
            match_LC_classes = match_LC_classes,
            kernel_radius = 1,
            simulation_type = "fuzzy",
            fuzzy_multiplier = 1.5,
            discrete_output_map = TRUE,
            random_seed = 5255,
            output_file_prefix = "UK_DS_example",
            output_dir_path = "LandScaleR_example_fuzzy/")
```

Before visualising the downscaled maps, first load two packages that we will use
for plotting into R.

```{r Load packages}
library("terra")
library("RColorBrewer")
```

Load the downscaled maps generated with the `"deterministic"` and `"fuzzy"` 
methods in 2012 and the actual HILDA+ map from the same year.

```{r Load and plot 2012 maps}
hilda_2012 <- rast(system.file("extdata/20230211_HILDA_UK_LULC_2012.tif",
                               package = "LandScaleR"))
deterministic_2012 <- rast("LandScaleR_example/UK_DS_example_Discrete_Time3.tif")
fuzzy_2012 <- rast("LandScaleR_example_fuzzy/UK_DS_example_Discrete_Time3.tif")

hilda_2012
deterministic_2012
fuzzy_2012
```

The HILDA+ map from 2012 contains different values to the downscaled maps. We 
can add categories to the HILDA+ map using the `terra::levels()` function so 
that the values match those in the downscaled maps.

```{r Add levels to HILDA+ 2012}
LC_classes <- c("11", "22", "33", "40", "41", "44", "45", "55", "66", "77")
LC_levels <- data.frame(id = as.numeric(LC_classes),
                        Land_cover = ref_map_classes)

levels(hilda_2012) <- LC_levels
hilda_2012
```

Plot the HILDA+ and two downscaled maps for comparison using the code below.

```{r Plot 2010 maps comparison,fig.height=8,fig.width=7,fig.cap="LULC in 2012 from HILDA+ and downscaling with the determininistic and fuzzy options. The fuzzy downscaling simulation used an f-value of 1.5."}
discrete_LC_palette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(10, "Set3"))(10)

layout(matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2, 
                3, 3, 3, 4),
              byrow = TRUE,
              nrow = 2,
              ncol = 4))
plot(hilda_2012,
     col = discrete_LC_palette,
     main = "HILDA+",
     legend = FALSE,
     axes = FALSE)
plot(deterministic_2012,
     main = "Deterministic",

     legend = FALSE,
     axes = FALSE)
plot(fuzzy_2012,

```

It can be difficult to see differences between the three maps of the UK above. 
We can plot just a small area of the UK instead to better see how the two 
downscaling methods agree with the actual HILDA+ data in 2012. First, set up a
`terra::SpatVector` object with four coordinates that form a rectangle around an
area of interest.

```{r Set up polygon}
zoom_x_coords <- c(-0, 0, 2.5, 2.5)
zoom_y_coords <- c(50.5, 51.5, 51.5, 50.5)

zoom_coords <- cbind(id = 1, 
                     part = 1, 
                     x = zoom_x_coords, 
                     y = zoom_y_coords)
  
zoom_polygon <- vect(zoom_coords, 
                     type = "polygons", 
                     crs = "EPSG:4326")
```

Use the `zoom_polygon` object to crop each map of LULC in 2012 to the region of
interest.

```{r Crop maps}
zoom_hilda_2012 <- crop(hilda_2012,
                        zoom_polygon)
zoom_deterministic_2012 <- crop(deterministic_2012,
                                zoom_polygon)
zoom_fuzzy_2012 <- crop(fuzzy_2012,
                        zoom_polygon)
```

Finally, plot the three cropped maps using the code below. Visually comparing 
the three maps suggests that the `"deterministic"` method of LULC allocation 
generated fewer, larger patches of LULC compared to the `"fuzzy"` method. The 
`"fuzzy"` map has smaller patches of LULC dispersed across the landscape and 
appears to be more similar to the actual HILDA+ map. Therefore, in this case we 
might conclude that the `"fuzzy"` method with $f = 1.5$ is more appropriate than 
the `"deterministic"` method for downscaling LULC change in the UK. Although we 
only visually compare the maps in this example, there are a variety of landscape 
pattern metrics available that can be calculated and used to compare downscaled
maps with historic LULC patterns. For example, the **landscapemetrics** R 
package [@hesselbarth_landscapemetrics_2019] can calculate a wide variety of 
landscape pattern metrics. Other metrics are also available to assess the 
accuracy of LULC maps, such as the Kappa and Figure of Merit indices 
[@garcia-alvarez_land_2022]. The paper that describes **LandScaleR** used 
accuracy and landscape pattern metrics to compare the effectiveness of the 
quasi-deterministic and fuzzy methods for downscaling historic LULC change in 
Colombia [@woodman_introducing_2023].

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="LULC in the south-east of the UK in 2012 from HILDA+ and downscaling with the determininistic and fuzzy options."}
layout(matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2, 
                3, 3, 3, 4),
              byrow = TRUE,
              nrow = 2,
              ncol = 4))
plot(zoom_hilda_2012,
     col = discrete_LC_palette,
     main = "HILDA+",
     mar = c(1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1),
     legend = FALSE,
     axes = FALSE)
plot(zoom_deterministic_2012,
     main = "Deterministic",
     col = discrete_LC_palette,
     mar = c(1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1),
     legend = FALSE,
     axes = FALSE)
plot(zoom_fuzzy_2012,
     main = "Fuzzy",
     col = discrete_LC_palette,
     mar = c(1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 10.1),
     axes = FALSE)
```

We can also look at the transitions that occur between different years in the
HILDA+ dataset versus downscaled maps. The code below will generate three maps
showing LULC transitions between 2009 and 2012 in the maps from HILDA+ and 
downscaling with the deterministic and fuzzy methods. 

```{r Generate transitions}
# Ensure all maps are the same extent
zoom_hilda_2012 <- crop(zoom_hilda_2012,
                        ext(zoom_deterministic_2012))

# Crop the HILDA+ map in 2009, which we loaded earlier in the vignette
zoom_hilda_2009 <- crop(reference_2009, 
                        ext(zoom_deterministic_2012))

# Make the levels in the HILDA+ 2009 map match those in the other maps
levels(zoom_hilda_2009) <- LC_levels

# Generate maps of transitions
# We multiply the LULC classes in one map by 100 so that we can create LULC transition categories in the format '1111' for cropland to cropland, and so on
# A value of '1122' in a transition map means that a grid cell was class 11 in 2009 and class 22 in 2012
zoom_hilda_transitions <- zoom_hilda_2012 + (zoom_hilda_2009 * 100)
zoom_deterministic_transitions <- zoom_deterministic_2012 + (zoom_hilda_2009 * 100)
zoom_fuzzy_transitions <- zoom_fuzzy_2012 + (zoom_hilda_2009 * 100)

# Check the values in the HILDA+ transitions SpatRaster
zoom_hilda_transitions
```

After defining the LULC transitions that occur between 2009 and 2012, we can 
process the transitions further to plot how well the downscaling method was able
to predict LULC change at the individual grid cell level. The meaning of the 
numbers in the plot below are:

* 1: Cells that changed in HILDA+ but did not change during downscaling.
* 2: Cells that changed in both and were correctly predicted by downscaling.
* 3: Cells that changed in both and were incorrectly predicted by downscaling.
* 4: Cells that were unchanged in HILDA+ but changed during downscaling.
* 5: Cells that did not change in either HILDA+ or during downscaling.

We can use the `terra::barplot()` function to plot the number of grid cells in 
which LULC transitions were correctly or incorrectly predicted during 
downscaling. The fuzzy method of LULC allocation appears to have correctly 
predicted LULC transitions (category 2) in slightly fewer cells than the 
deterministic method.

```{r Plot correct transition proportions,fig.height=4,fig.width=7,fig.cap="Number of correctly and incorrectly predicted LULC transitions between 2009 and 2012 in the downscaled maps generated with the deterministic and fuzzy methods."}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
barplot(zoom_deterministic_correct,
        col = discrete_LC_palette,
        ylim = c(0, 6000),
        main = "Deterministic")
barplot(zoom_fuzzy_correct,
        col = discrete_LC_palette,
        ylim = c(0, 6000),
        main = "Fuzzy")
